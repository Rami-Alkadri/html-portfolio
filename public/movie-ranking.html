<h1>The Best Movies According to Rami</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>
    Watched this movie on Turkish Airlines. I thought it would be 
    overrated, but was very much wrong. One of the best movies of
    all time
</p>
<h3>The Martian</h3>
<p>
    A great film. I have zero complaints or reservations about 
    this movie; it is spectacular from start to finish.
</p>
<h3>The Wolf of Wall Street</h3>
<p>
   I don't care that this is every finance bro's favorite movie. I 
   love Leonardo DiCaprio and his depiction of Jordan Belfort. This 
   movie is wildly entertaining.
